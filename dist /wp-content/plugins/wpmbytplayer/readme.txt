== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm using the plug in as background video and I can see the control bar on the bottom but the video doesn't display =
 Your theme is probably using a wrapper for the content and it probably has a background color or image. You should check the CSS and remove that background to let the video that is behind do display correctly.

= Does it work on mobile devices =
Yes! the only difference is that the background video starts once the device scrin is touched after the page has been loaded.

= I would have an image on the background before the video starts and after the video end; how can I do? =
The simplest way is to add an image as background of the body via CSS.

= I set the video quality to hd1080 but it doesn't display at this quality; why? =
The video quality option is just a suggestion for the Youtube API; the video is served by Youtube with the quality that best fits the bandwidth and the display size according to that setting.

= The video stops some seconds before the real end; why? =
To prevent the display of the "play" button provided by the Youtube API the video intentionally stops some seconds before the end; if you are the owner of the video I can suggest to make it a little bit longer (about 3/4 seconds).

= I love your plugin! What can I do to help?
Creating and supporting this plugin takes up a lot of my free time, therefore I would highly appreciate if you could take a couple of minutes to write a review. This will help other WordPress users to start using this plugin and keep me motivated to maintain and support it. You can also make a donation to support my work!
